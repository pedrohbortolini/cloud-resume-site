ðŸ”— [View the site here](https://pedrobortolini.com.br)

This project is part of the **Cloud Resume Challenge**, in which I completed the first stage: developing and automating the deployment of a static website hosted on AWS.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the static website
* **Amazon S3** for hosting
* **Amazon CloudFront with Certificate Manager** for global distribution with HTTPS
* **Route 53 and Registro.br** for domain management
* **GitHub Actions** for deployment automation (CI/CD)

## Features

* Personal website/resume hosted in the cloud
* Automated deployment: the site updates automatically with every `git push`

## Next Steps

* Integrate with an API (AWS Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB) to display a visitor counter
